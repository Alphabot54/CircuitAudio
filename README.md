# CircuitAudio
### Mission
The goal with CircuitAudio is to create an application that allows the user to build circuits and then to run audio through it. This project is for guitar pedal builders and desingers specifically so that they can digitally create and test pedal circuits. This project also has the educational purpose to help people understand what happen to electical signals when they go through a circuit.
